I had to wait for more than an hour for a tow truck and then return to the airport with the car.  Overall, the process took 2 hours of my time, just to start from square one again at the airport. There was another customer ahead of me complaining that the car they just rented had car seats in the back still and was filled  with trash.

Many of us just do it because, not because of a sad poster in your window.\n\nI noticed on a few occasions that the strong odor of pot would suddenly make its presence known to my nostrils on turning a corner. During mid-day. But hey, it's legal here so deal with it. That and the skateboarding mid-30's adult who cut between the dining tables where you may be sitting and trying to eat.\n\nNo thanks Burlington, we won't miss each other in the future.",
