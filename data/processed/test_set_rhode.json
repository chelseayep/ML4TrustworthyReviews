Everything is very organized and the process of pick up and drop off goes smoothly. They really care about the dogs there, so much so that they do an interview to make sure your dog will get along well with other dogs and get the most of his or her camp experience.

Every time we tried to talk to him he answered with one word sentences like he was too busy. Although he had quite a long conversation with the patrons at the tables on either side of us, he acted like we didnt exist. The bus boy delivered us our meal! At that point we finished up and took our food to go. I never saw a smile on the waiters face until he dropped off the check. (Probably because he wanted the tip) we assumed from previous comments on this site that unless you are a regular, you are treated badly from the staff.

    "text": "I received a gift card for $75. I looked at the menu saw they had a paint reconditioning service. Decided I would get this service.....   Let me add my paint is not bad at all. I’ve gotten compliments on how well my paint looks for the year of the car.\nJust from calling to make an appointment I wasn’t happy. Apparently when you get this service you have to get a wax coating done. That is an extra $49 dollar charge. I asked if I could do this on my own. Not allowed! So why not just make the service $125 which is came out to!? It’s the gimmick how they bring you in. Okay fine I’ll pay the extra. Upon calling and finding out about these extra charges I made an appointment for 12 o’clock. Arrived 5 minutes early. No parking no attendant/worker to be found. Finally I park near the vacuums then check in.\nDidn’t seem to care I had an appointment. Got the same speech I got on the phone “Typically takes 2-21/2 hours some times longer. Okay fine with me 3 hours or so. Nope!! After 4 hours I called and got “your detailer says it will be ready for 4:30” I arrive at 4:30 car is sitting outside looking good. No one around garage doors shut! I do a once around looks decent not going to complain. Yes they pulled some surfaces scratches out but that was about all.\nSo 41/2 hours later to do a job I could have done at home in about the same time. The following day I had a car show i was attending. Part of why I chosethis service to save me a day of work. I walk out the next morning and start noticed excess wax spots. I work those spots in.\nUnfortunately it rained during the car show and in my travels. It’s now two days later there is white all over!! Seems it was rushed.\n\nSo my final say is if you are going to get a cut and buff service find a good auto body shop. It will cost you the same. Maybe a little more but it won’t turn out how this has.\n\nI will say after these issues. I did work with the manager and asst manager and got these resolved. so my review remains the same on the work. Customer satisfaction I will give 5 stars",

My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy which was also super tasty. Everything on the menu sounded amazing it took us a good 15 minutes to make our final decision. Molly our server was spectacular. Finally got to try Nitro Carts nitro brew and it was heavenly as I hoped it would be. Do yourself a flavor and have brunch, lunch, or dinner here, you wont be disappointed.\n\nJust an FYI they don't have home fries, they're hash browns. For all those home fry lovers like my husband.

I had ordered a rice bowl and the waitress accidentally brought me a noodle bowl ( I have a gluten allergy) so I very kindly asked her for the rice bowl again. When the rice bowl finally came out there was a piece of hair that was blatantly and deliberately placed right on top. I have worked in restaurants before and I know how some chefs react to food being returned to the kitchen. Absolutely disgusting.",
