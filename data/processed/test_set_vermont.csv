"This icon of Burlington has seen better days. Yes, Wuhan virus adaptive measures by the state have caused a lot of challenges. But more to my point is that I felt like I was in a protest parade and that every shop was a posterboard for multiple causes.

A word to Merchants: sometimes people just want to shop, not be involuntarily exposed to something they may have already paid a lot of attention to. Many of us just do it because, not because of a sad poster in your window.

I noticed on a few occasions that the strong odor of pot would suddenly make its presence known to my nostrils on turning a corner. During mid-day. But hey, it's legal here so deal with it.
