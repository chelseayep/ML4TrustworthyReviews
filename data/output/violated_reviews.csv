"Food was VERY good, probably the best my husband and I ever had. The waiter was ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE!!! HE took our drink order very rudely asking what we wanted-- acting like he was doing us a favor. We advised him it was our first time there and if he had any recommendations, then he basically walked away leaving us to ""guess"" what we wanted for dinner. Every time we tried to talk to him he answered with one word sentences like he was too busy. Although he had quite a long conversation with the patrons at the tables on either side of us, he acted like we didnt exist. The bus boy delivered us our meal! At that point we finished up and took our food to go. I never saw a smile on the waiters face until he dropped off the check. (Probably because he wanted the tip) we assumed from previous comments on this site that unless you are a regular, you are treated badly from the staff.  WE WOULD NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE OR GO THERE AGAIN! too bad since the food was so delicious",1,Antonio's Trattoria,['not credible'],[]

"I received a gift card for $75. I looked at the menu saw they had a paint reconditioning service. Decided I would get this service.....   Let me add my paint is not bad at all. I‚Äôve gotten compliments on how well my paint looks for the year of the car.
Just from calling to make an appointment I wasn‚Äôt happy. Apparently when you get this service you have to get a wax coating done. That is an extra $49 dollar charge. I asked if I could do this on my own. Not allowed! So why not just make the service $125 which is came out to!? It‚Äôs the gimmick how they bring you in. Okay fine I‚Äôll pay the extra. Upon calling and finding out about these extra charges I made an appointment for 12 o‚Äôclock. Arrived 5 minutes early. No parking no attendant/worker to be found. Finally I park near the vacuums then check in.
Didn‚Äôt seem to care I had an appointment. Got the same speech I got on the phone ‚ÄúTypically takes 2-21/2 hours some times longer. Okay fine with me 3 hours or so. Nope!! After 4 hours I called and got ‚Äúyour detailer says it will be ready for 4:30‚Äù I arrive at 4:30 car is sitting outside looking good. No one around garage doors shut! I do a once around looks decent not going to complain. Yes they pulled some surfaces scratches out but that was about all.
So 41/2 hours later to do a job I could have done at home in about the same time. The following day I had a car show i was attending. Part of why I chosethis service to save me a day of work. I walk out the next morning and start noticed excess wax spots. I work those spots in.
Unfortunately it rained during the car show and in my travels. It‚Äôs now two days later there is white all over!! Seems it was rushed.

So my final say is if you are going to get a cut and buff service find a good auto body shop. It will cost you the same. Maybe a little more but it won‚Äôt turn out how this has.

I will say after these issues. I did work with the manager and asst manager and got these resolved. so my review remains the same on the work. Customer satisfaction I will give 5 stars",2,ScrubaDub Car Wash,['not relevant'],[]
